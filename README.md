# Cyber Security Project - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.


## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking

Description: User side (firefox browser) is on the left, its the one we used to log in and aquire the session id. Right side is the attacker side (chrome browser), it uses the same session id of the user in order to hijack the user's session. Once we paste and change the user's id to the attacker's side, we can easily log in using that same session id. We can also force log out the user if we log out from the attacker's side.

Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Description: Inject the SQLI below as URL encoded and paste it where the id number is in the site url. Doing so reveals the tables and columns found in the
database. This info could be useful to attackers to easily search for information they would want.
```
' AND 0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,GROUP_CONCAT(table_name,0x2e,column_name,"\n") FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema=database(); -- 
```

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

Description: Trying to log in as a user that does not exist returns a "login unsuccessful" in normal font and the inspection shows that it's classified as 'failed',
but attemoting to log in as a user that does exit returns "login unsuccessful" in bold font and inspection shows it differently classified as 'failure'.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Description: Using a public/logged out session, contact and leave a feedback form for the admin to view using the XSS below. Whenever the admin views the 
feedback forms/messages, it will automatically perform the XSS vulernbility. 
```
<script>alert('KimG thinks you have an XSS issue!');</script>
```

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Description: Red site is exposed to IDOR exploits, this can be seen by using the public/logged out session. Scrolling through the public only salesperson list
us to view only the salespeople allowed to the public, UNTIL you try to switch the id numbers in the url at the top. We can see the private profiles in the admin logged in session and see if we attempt to ctrl + f and search for the names in the public site that the names 'Testy' and 'Lazy' don't exist in 
the list publicly, yet we can access the profiles by chnaging the id numbers in the URL. Ids 10 and 11 contains "private" profiles that should not be 
available to the public but can be exploited to view.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Description: Aquiring the edit form code in order to copy and input your own values as the attacker. Make sure the code is modified to auto submit the request 
 once visited. Then save the code in a text file and save it as an html. As a logged out/public user, send a contact or feedback message to the admin. It could 
 be disguised asa normal message with a link to the created harmful html. Once the admin visits the link, the site automatically edits the profile that we choose, 
 in this case my code chose to edit/attack id = 1 profile, AKA Gary Lane. Once the admin visited the site it, refreshing the profile of id =1, it shows the changes  modified/edited to my alias name KDG, along with my own other info i choose to edit.

## Notes


The Cross-Site Request Forgery was the hardest one to do, trying to copy the edit form when inspecting and making it accept/submit the form automatically as a website
in order for the admin to be tricked and exploit it. SQL Injection for the blue site was also tough in order to execute and make. As well as exlpoiting it to the
point of exposing the tables and columns and their names.
